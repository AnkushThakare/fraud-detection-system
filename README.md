## 💻 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnkushThakare/fraud-detection-system.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd fraud-detection-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage
```bash
# Run the main script
python main.py
```
For more detailed usage instructions, check the documentation [here](docs/USAGE.md).

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is `creditcard.csv`. However, due to its size, it is not included in the repository. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## 🏋️ Model Training
To train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will process the dataset and train a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

## 📈 Results
After training, the model will output accuracy, precision, recall, and an ROC curve. Logs and metrics will be stored in the `logs/` directory.
